I'm a Technical Leader on the [Medical Computing Team](https://www.kitware.com/medical-computing-team/) at [Kitware](https://kitware.com) where I focus on creating, guiding, and growing medical imaging software applications built on open source technology. Visual fidelity, data security, as well as 510(k) and HIPAA compliance are fundamental to my development process. I have worked with a wide range of medical device companies ranging from young startups to industry giants.

I am a seasoned software developer with a diverse background in computer graphics, scientific visualization, and medical imaging. I have worked on a wide variety of technologies ranging from reverse engineering, digital inspection, 3D printing, digital dentistry and orthodontics, ultrasound, MR and CT imaging, point cloud reconstruction, rendering, and much more.

I have shipped both commercial and open source applications on all platforms. I will happily work in _most_ languages within any stack.
